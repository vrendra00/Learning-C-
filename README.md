## Why C++?

C++ is a powerful, high-performance language widely used in systems programming, game development, embedded systems, and competitive programming. By learning C++, I aim to:

- Strengthen my understanding of object-oriented programming
- Dive deeper into memory management and performance optimization
- Build real-world C++ projects

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🧑‍💻 Run with g++ (Linux/Mac/Windows WSL)

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```

### 🪟 Run on Windows (using `g++` via MinGW or similar)

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output.exe
output.exe
```

### ✅ Run in VS Code
1. Install the **C/C++ extension** from Microsoft
2. Save your `.cpp` file
3. Right-click inside the file → **Run Code** (requires [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner))
4. Or use the integrated terminal:
   ```bash
   g++ yourfile.cpp -o yourfile
   ./yourfile
   ```
